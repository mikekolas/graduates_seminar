# Graduates_seminar

  This project is the implementation of the topic "Internet of Things infrastructure development with the use of Blynk platform" that my
team undertook in the course "Graduates Seminar". The aim of this course is to work with a team in order to make a project, write an essay
and present it to fellow colleagues. The teacher evaluates team's work and grade each individual seperately. The grade was 10/10.
